# R Code for Meta-Analysis Books

This repo contains R code to reproduce the examples and illustrations from various books on meta-analysis (well, only two at the moment, but this will be expanded in the future).

The code is provided as [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents, which are rendered to HTML files. You can download the repo and open up the HTML files with your browser. Or you can look at the HTML files online here:

* [Practical Meta-Analysis](http://www.metafor-project.org/misc/lipsey2001.html) by Lipsey and Wilson (2001)

* [Introduction to Meta-Analysis](http://www.metafor-project.org/misc/borenstein2009.html) by Borenstein et al. (2009)

Feel free to suggest books via the [Issues](https://github.com/wviechtb/meta_analysis_books/issues).

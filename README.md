# R Code for Meta-Analysis Books

This repo contains R code to reproduce the examples and illustrations from various books on meta-analysis.

The code is provided as [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents, which are rendered to HTML files. You can download the repo and open up the HTML files with your browser. Or you can look at the files online here:

* [Practical Meta-Analysis](https://wviechtb.github.io/meta_analysis_books/lipsey2001.html) by Lipsey and Wilson (2001)

* [Introduction to Meta-Analysis](https://wviechtb.github.io/meta_analysis_books/borenstein2009.html) by Borenstein et al. (2009)

* [The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis](https://wviechtb.github.io/meta_analysis_books/cooper2019.html) by Cooper et al. (2019) (note: this one isn't complete yet)

Feel free to adapt and incorporate the files into your own teaching materials.

Suggestions for improvements to the existing documents are more than welcome. Also, if you would like to suggest other books to be covered, you can do so via [Issues](https://github.com/wviechtb/meta_analysis_books/issues).
